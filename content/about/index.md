**Hello and welcome to my personal website!**

My name is Samuel Kellerhals, and I am a Software Engineer currently working at ETH Zurich where I am helping further develop a performance portable version of the [ICON](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/iconpublic) climate model developed by the [DWD](https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html). In particular I have been building Fortran and C++ Code Generation tools to facilitate the deployment of numerical stencils written in [GT4Py](https://github.com/GridTools/gt4py) in a Fortran-based production codebase.

In addition to my current role, I have had a diverse range of experiences working in a variety of environments from startups to scale-ups, and have completed research projects at the interface between academia and industry. I have a broad range of skills, including experience in Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Web Development.

One of my proudest achievements is having founded [Elpis Solar](https://elpissolar.com/). In this project we developed off-grid solar devices to bring essential services such as mobile phone charging, clean water and offline educational content to refugee communities. This experience first triggered my interest in using software to turn ideas into reality.

I am passionate about working on interesting projects that have real-world impact, particularly anything climate and energy related. Thank you for visiting my personal website! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects or collaborations.
